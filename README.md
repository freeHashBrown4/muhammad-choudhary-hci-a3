# Muhammad Choudhary HCI Assignment 3

## About

This git repo is for the prototype for HCI assignment 2. Most if not all student have a smart phone and use it more than computers. This app is designed for students to access all the course content from their smart phones.
I will also help students to stay productive because they can easily use their phone instead of computers to access the course content.
